                <h2>Healing Through Movement and Breath</h2>
                <p class="intro">At Yoga Therapy, we believe that yoga is far more than physical postures—it's a comprehensive system for healing body, mind, and spirit. Our yoga therapy approach combines ancient wisdom with modern understanding to support your unique journey toward wellness and wholeness.</p>

                <h2>What is Yoga Therapy?</h2>
                <p>Yoga therapy is the professional application of yogic principles and practices to promote health and well-being within a therapeutic relationship. Unlike general yoga classes, yoga therapy sessions are specifically designed for your individual needs, health conditions, and personal goals. We work with you to create a personalized practice that addresses physical limitations, emotional patterns, and life circumstances.</p>

                <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                <p>We recognize that each person's path to healing is unique. Our certified yoga therapists take time to understand your complete health picture—physical symptoms, emotional well-being, lifestyle factors, and personal aspirations. Together, we develop a tailored practice that may include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Gentle movement and therapeutic postures</li>
                    <li>Breathwork and meditation techniques</li>
                    <li>Relaxation and stress management tools</li>
                    <li>Mindfulness practices for daily life</li>
                    <li>Education about yogic principles and philosophy</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
                <p>Our doors are open to everyone seeking healing and growth. We work with individuals experiencing chronic pain, anxiety, depression, trauma, autoimmune conditions, and life transitions. Whether you're dealing with a specific health challenge or simply seeking greater balance and vitality, yoga therapy can meet you where you are.</p>

                <p>No previous yoga experience is necessary. Our practices are adapted to your current abilities and comfort level, making healing accessible regardless of physical limitations or mobility challenges.</p>

                <h2>Your Journey Begins Here</h2>
                <p>Healing happens in relationship—with yourself, with others, and with the present moment. We're honored to support you in discovering the wisdom your body and breath have to offer. Every session is an opportunity to reconnect with your innate capacity for wellness and transformation.</p>
